<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a passionate Software Engineering student with a solid
   grasp of programming fundamentals, including proficiency in C# and C++, 
   and hands-on experience with database systems like MS Access and SQL.</p>

<p> My skill set spans object-oriented programming (OOP), basic data structures
   and algorithms (DSA), and practical applications such as web scraping for data extraction.I possess foundational expertise in software engineering, including 
   architectural styles, requirements analysis, system design, and software testing.<p/>


<p> Recently, I’ve expanded my expertise to include computer networking basics,
   understanding protocols, network layers, and communication principles. Passionate about solving real-world problems,
    I enjoy bridging software development with system-level insights—whether automating workflows, designing efficient 
    databases, or exploring how applications interact with networks.<p/>

<p> Eager to grow further, I aim to deepen my knowledge in full-stack development, software architecture,
     and networked systems while contributing to impactful tech solutions.</p>
